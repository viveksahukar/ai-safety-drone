## Class project for CSE598 AI Safety Course

### Daniel Bramblett, Vivek Sahukar

The code files pertain to running the Ingenuity (NASA Helicopter) example in the Isaac Gym. The `Ingenuity.py` files introduce the obstacle in the environment and different shields in addition to the standard environment provided by the Isaac gym. The task for the Ingenuity is to learn to circumnavigate the obstacle (red sphere) and reach the target (green sphere).

There are four different versions of the `Ingenuity.py` file: no shield, Hard shield, Soft shield, and Hybrid Shield. The shields get activated whenever the Ingenuity is in range of the obstacle.

The other two `.yaml` files provide the configuration for running the example with various options.

#### The final project report is `final-project-report-ai-safety-drone-flight.pdf` and the final presentation file is `ai-safety-drone-flight-presentation.pdf`.
